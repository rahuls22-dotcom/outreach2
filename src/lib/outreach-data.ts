//   draft       → outreach created, no audience uploaded yet (and so no
//                 dialing can happen). This replaces the old "scheduled"
//                 state — there's no longer a separate "queued but
//                 starting later" status; an outreach is either still
//                 being set up (draft) or actually running.
//   in_progress → dialing is happening (or about to, immediately).
//   paused      → was running, user (or system) paused it.
//   completed   → the entire audience has been processed.
