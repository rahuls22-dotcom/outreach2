// Diagnostic Spot workflows — Scale · Optimize · Test New Angles.
//
// The mental model is "Claude does the heavy lifting, the human approves
// once". So each workflow has only THREE steps, not four-or-more:
//
//   1. clarify  — Spot asks 2-3 quick questions to lock the brief,
//                 user verifies. On the right pane, a Brief card fills
//                 in as questions get answered.
//   2. plan     — Spot autonomously runs the analysis (memory.read +
//                 personas.fetch + creative.audit + competitor.scan +
//                 plan.build, all in parallel) and presents ONE plan
//                 with a time-phased structure (Week 1 / Week 2 / Week
//                 3, what Spot will do, what it'll observe, the
//                 decision points and guardrails). User approves once.
//   3. live     — Plan is running. Canvas shows the active phase, the
//                 timeline, and recommendations Spot has surfaced for
//                 human approval (those also feed the dashboard).
//
// This file holds:
//   · Clarifying questions per workflow kind
//   · Time-phased plan templates per workflow kind
//   · Pending recommendations Spot surfaces during live execution
//   · Step ordering + labels + tool-call narration + intro messages
//
// All copy is Guyju's-themed (EdTech) so the demo holds together.

_Spot's read · last 30 days. Two ad sets are winning with real headroom, and Brand Search defense is leaving free volume on the table._

### Top line

Two ad sets are winning with significant headroom left, and Brand Search is severely underspent at near-100% intent. There's clear room to push without breaking what's working.

### What's winning

- **JEE Crack · LAL · Class 11 parents** — best CPL on the workspace at **₹336** (down 22% WoW), qualification up 7pts to 14.4%. Only **28% audience saturation**, so room to roughly 2× spend before reach plateaus.
- **JEE Crack · TOFU · Mentor-led hook** — strongest qualified-lead pull at **₹356** CPL, qualification 13.7% (up 5pts). At 52% saturation, and the 1% lookalike seed has just crossed the threshold to launch.

### Where the headroom is

- **BOFU · Demo-abandoner retargeting** is underspent by ~60% — ₹38K against the warm demo-abandoner pool, sitting on a tiny cap. Reach share has slipped 8pts to 69%.
- The 1% lookalike seed cohort hit 248 qualified leads (verified + qualified pool now 860). Sharper than the visitor lookalike we used to run.
- Top 2 winning Reels run on Feed only — workspace benchmarks show +18% CTR on Stories for video-led EdTech creative.

### Biggest single problem

Not enough money chasing the winners. Brand Search defense alone has ~₹50K/week of free, near-100%-intent volume going uncaptured.

### What memory says

- Mentor-led hook outperforms the rank-focused hook by 31% on hold-rate (logged May 24).
- The workspace audience graph shows no saturation at the audience level on the two winners.

### Recommendation

- Stage budget onto the two winners and lift the BOFU retargeting cap toward the warm pool.
- Launch the new 1% lookalike from the verified + qualified cohort.
- Open Stories placements on the top Reels and hold guardrails on CPL drift before each lift.

  reportMd: `## Optimize audit · Guyju's JEE Crack

_Spot's read · last 14 days. Two different problems sit side by side: a recent decay on NEET TOFU and a chronic underperformer on Foundation. Different root causes, different fixes._

### Top line

NEET TOFU was working until two weeks ago — CPL jumped 18% with a falling qualification rate. Foundation 9-10 has underperformed since launch. These are separate problems and I'd treat them separately.

### Recent decay · NEET Pro · TOFU · Parents-see-progress

CPL is up 13% to **₹612**, qualification down 3.6pts to 9.5%, and frequency is at **5.2×** against a 4× cap. Three things broke at once:

- **Creative fatigue** — the top Reel passed frequency 5.2 and CTR slid from 2.4% to 1.49% over 21 days. We're spending against an exhausted audience.
- **Sentiment** — 14 negative comments in three days flagged the "Parents see weekly progress" hook as surveillance framing. Sentiment dropped from +0.78 to −0.18; Meta's relevance score fell from 8 to 5.
- **Competitor pressure** — Allen launched a ₹6K NEET price drop on May 12. Our /pricing click-through dropped 41% the same day.

### Chronic · Foundation 9-10 · Lab-bench hook

- CPL has never hit target since launch — **₹657** against a ₹420 target, qualification 6.6% against a 12% average.
- The lab-bench hook reads as "play-school" to JEE-prep parents. Memory already carries the constraint ("avoid pressure-free framing"); the Creative Agent missed it on the brief.
- The /pricing landing page hides the mobile CTA below the fold — 71% of visitors never reach it; average mobile session is 24s.

### Biggest single problem

NEET TOFU decay. Three causes stacked at once and CPL is still climbing, so this is the one to stop first.

### What memory says

- Mentor-led hook outperforms rank-focused (May 24) — the obvious replacement hook.
- Constraint: avoid pressure-free framing, parents read it as unserious (May 18).

### Recommendation

- Ship the small reversible fixes first: pause the fatigued Reel, brief two fresh NEET hooks, re-frame the surveillance line.
- Counter-position on price and rewrite the Foundation brief to respect the memory constraint.
- Hold targeting steady and re-measure CPL before any bigger swing; rebuild the Foundation page only with sign-off.

_Spot's read · last 30 days, Engineer Parent persona. The winners and losers split along a clean line, so the pattern is sharp enough to generate fresh angles against._

### Top line

Engineer Parent has 3 clear winners and 2 clear losers. Winners share a pattern (specificity + autonomy); losers share the inverse (anxiety + outcome promises). The split is clean enough to brief new angles from.

### What's winning

- **"Mentor-led · capped at 60"** — best CPL on the persona at **₹312**, qualification 16.8%, CTR 2.81%. Specific plus authority framing.
- The winning concepts all lean specific and student-owned — a named constraint, a concrete moment, the learner in control.

### What's losing

- **"All-India ranked mocks weekly"** — CPL **₹612** against a ₹360 target. Anxiety framing; 6 of 9 top comments express stress.
- **"Crack JEE — guaranteed strategy"** — CPL **₹584**, qualification down to 3.4%. Outcome promise triggers skepticism, and it's already flagged in memory.

### The pattern

- **Winners:** specificity + autonomy — name the moment, name the constraint, let the kid own it.
- **Losers:** anxiety + outcome promises — vague pressure and guarantees parents don't trust.

### Biggest single problem

A few loud losers in the rotation are dragging the cohort CPL up. Replacing them with insight-grounded angles should lift the whole portfolio, not just the test cells.

### Constraints any new angle must respect

- No rank or outcome guarantees — legal flagged this.
- No name-checking competitors.
- Mentor-led framing beats rank-focused by 31% on hold-rate (logged).

### Recommendation

- Generate a fresh set of angles off the winning pattern (specificity + parent autonomy), each screened against the memory constraints.
- Run them on the Engineer Parent ad set (highest volume, fastest signal), prune fast, scale what breaks out.
