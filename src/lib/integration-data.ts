// is configured on its own tab. Two directions:
//  - inbound + callback (enrichment, ai_calling): client calls our API, we run
//    the job async and POST the result back to the client's callback URL.
//  - callback only (campaigns): WE create new leads and deliver each one to the
//    client's callback URL. Nothing to call inbound — they just give us a URL.
